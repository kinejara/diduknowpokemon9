		<string>In Black and White, the only differences between Drayden and Iris&apos;s teams are the genders of their Pokémon and their Druddigon&apos;s Ability: Drayden has an all-male team and his Druddigon has Rough Skin, while Iris has an all-female team and her Druddigon has Sheer Force.</string>
		<string>Victini&apos;s Unova Pokédex number is 000, making it the first Pokémon to legitimately have the number 000 in any Pokédex listing.</string>
		<string>Although Victini has a Shiny sprite, Pokémon Black and White are programmed so that a Shiny Victini cannot be encountered. It shares this trait with Reshiram and Zekrom.</string>
		<string>According to an IGN interview, Victini is Junichi Masuda&apos;s favorite Generation V Pokémon.</string>

		<string>Generation IV is the only generation in which two core series game names have the same first initial in English (Pearl and Platinum). However, other languages have had the same initial in their game names, with Spanish Azul and Amarillo for Blue and Yellow, and German Saphir and Smaragd for Sapphire and Emerald.</string>

		<string>Diamond and Pearl are the first games where:All three starter Pokémon gain a second type through evolution and are utilized in the storyline.</string>
		<string>Pokémon Diamond and Pearl contain many references to Internet memes and chatspeak. This is possibly because the lead translator, Nob Ogasawara, is a member of the Something Awful Forums.</string>
		<string>The leaders and Elite Four of Sinnoh do not always use Pokémon of their specialized type. This problem was fixed in Platinum with an expansion added to the Pokédex.</string>
		<string>Diamond and Pearl are the first core series Pokémon games that require their saved data to be deleted before saving a new game. However, the first in the series to have such requirement were Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team.</string>
		<string>Diamond and Pearl are also the first two games in which baby Pokémon previously available only through breeding can be found in the wild, if one doesn&apos;t count catching Wynaut on Mirage Island in the Hoenn-based games.</string>

		<string>Azelf appears to be a pixie or a fairy, although its Japanese name suggests that it&apos;s a gnome. Azelf and the rest of the trio could possibly have originated from the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which are also called the Three Sacred Treasures.

		<string>Although Pokémon Gold and Silver are compatible with all Game Boy models (original up to the Game Boy Advance SP), Crystal will not work on models prior to the Game Boy Color. This is due to the cartridges being of different models.</string>
		<string>Gold and Silver only have 30 unique sound clips used for Pokemon cries in addition to the previous 37 from Red and Blue.</string>

		<string>In terms of release dates, Generation II is the shortest generation in Japan, with exactly three years between the release of Gold and Silver and Ruby and Sapphire.</string>
		<string>Generation II leaves the least extra space for Pokémon in the Storage System if one of every species is caught. Only 280 Pokémon may be obtained at once; there are 251 different Pokémon species available in this generation.</string>
		<string>Generation II features the first main series game, Crystal, whose Japanese title is in katakana only and that uses an English word, rather than using the Japanese counterpart word in kanji. No game since has been named in kanji.</string>
		<string>Unlike other Generations, should player use a cheat in Generation II game to get into tall grass without a Pokémon, the fight will instantly end (and be treated as victory in case of Trainers), instead of sending a glitch Pokémon.</string>
		<string>Crystal was originally known as &apos;Pokémon X&apos; prior to its release. Another core series Pokémon game would later go on to use this title.</string>
		<string>230</string>
		<string>People buying a Game Boy Color during the release of this game were given the option of buying a Game Boy Advance that came with Pokémon Crystal in the package.</string>

		<string>pinarak can be seen as a parallel to Ledyba. Both of them are Bug-type Generation II Pokémon. Spinarak is exclusive to Pokémon Gold and HeartGold, while Ledyba is exclusive to Silver and SoulSilver.</string>
		<string>Teddiursa is one of fourteen Pokémon that one can collect foreign Pokédex entries for in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</string>
		<string>Teddiursa and Phanpy, along with their evolutions, are the only Pokémon to swap version-exclusive status between localizations.</string>

		<string>Hoenn starts a running theme that the player gets their starting Pokémon not in a lab.</string>
		<string>The routes on the Sevii Islands are not numbered, unlike the other regions.
